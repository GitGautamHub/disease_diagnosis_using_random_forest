# Disease Diagnosis using Random Forest  

This repository contains a **Random Forest Classifier** model for disease diagnosis. The model is trained using **GridSearchCV** to optimize hyperparameters and improve accuracy.  

## Features  
- Uses **Random Forest Classifier** for disease prediction  
- Performs **hyperparameter tuning** using **GridSearchCV**  
- Allows **user input** for symptom-based disease diagnosis  
- Generates **classification reports** and **confusion matrices** for evaluation  

## Output
The model predicts the most likely disease based on the given symptoms.
